| September 11 | 10:30pm-12:02am | Been thinking hard about this problem set and I think it will be important to one get rid of the first base case of the problem. Then, make sure I can know the number of neighbors or degrees of each city so I made the loop. I think there will be some sort of BFS to search through it but still pondering how to go about that step. |
